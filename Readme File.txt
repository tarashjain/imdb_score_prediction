THE IMDB score prediction. 

The intend was to build a model that predicts the immdb sore of the movies in R. 

The code (Analysis Code) also includes statistical analysis of different variables and the target variable depends each independent variable. 
 
We have linear regression in this model to predict  the IMDB Score. 

Below are the instruction for predicting the movie score using the model. 

1. The section 1A of the code consists the final model which is used for prediction of IMDb score. 
	a. You need to run all the code in section one as we have filtered the IMDB dataset. 

2. The section 1B of the code consists the prediction part. We have assumed that the dataset 
	will be similar to one given to us without the IMDb score column.
	a. After loading the dataset, i.e. CSV file run all code lines to predict the user rating of the movie.

Please note that all for the packages used in the code, installing command has been put up in the code itself.
The analysis code file is attached in the report
